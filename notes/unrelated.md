your rule before you ask a Sr. dev for help
  document a list of things that I've tried before asking a sr. dev
  having a list documented shows that you are thinking about the situation, trying your best, trying not to bother him,.


oh, I can see how you meant that, I must have misunderstood. I'll redo it.

QA is great training for the brain
  if you are doing QA, you need to do devwork on the side to keep up.

'how to win friends and influence people'

learn how to manage up, hey you're doing a good job, this is going well, but I think I see an imrovement, tell me what you think.

job hoping
it is true that most companies, will not give you a significant raise, they're wanting 5-7 years of tiny bumps.

once I get a little bit of experience under my belt, I can re-evaluate and find better opportunities.

it's common for devs to plan on leaving jobs off and on, find a place they really like, and stick it out for the benifits.


ake sure that they are 10k-30k per yr jumps, not tiny increments. have other reasons that you left, so that you can answer honestly.

I work very hard for 40 hrs, and I get burnt out. I'm not looking for overtime.

negotiate, and show that you are considering if this is a correct fit. interview, the interviewers.

You get one free pass for jumping ships, the second you have two job changes in a short period of time, it looks really suspect on a resume.

go to your current company and try to negotiate when you get a high offer.

most companies are expecting at least 1-2 yrs.

2yrs per hop isn't even questioned.

spit out often websites on the side.

beig a Sr in less than a year, is highly questionable, I'd have to prove my seniority.



SALARY EXPECTATION

our grads are usually in the 40-55 range

timeframe was very set, he really wanted to work there and it was a way for him to get his foot in the door.

internships are closer to 40
startups are closer to 40, they usually offer other perks
  paired programming with a Sr.


if you can keep momentum,
  it's key
  if you keep your momentum for a yr, you should be in the 55-65k range for sure
  3-5mos at a lower rate, TOPS..


make sure that you are clear, that you are able to negotiate, if you are leveraging a higher offer.

be careful with highballing.
consider your portfolio, does it fit what I am asking for.

65+ means you can leave me alone for a few weeks, and you won't ever need to help me.
